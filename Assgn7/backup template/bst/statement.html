In the Himalaya Food Court, the cashier at the counter gives customers two
tokens for their order. They submit one token at the food counter, and wait
until their food arrives. When it does, their token number will be called, they
will return the second token to verify that the order was theirs, and then pick
up the food.
</p>

<p>
This is a fairly simple system, and any token based system will operate
similarly. Conceptually, we need to store a <i>collection</i> of tokens. When a
customer gives the first token, we need to add it to this collection. When the
customer returns the second token, we need to be able to search through this
collection, and if the token was found in the collection, it must be removed
from it. Many different data structures could be used to store this collection,
for example the linked lists you have already used. 
</p>

<p>
We will look at another way of storing these items; in a binary search tree.
Both adding and removing items to this list takes time on the order of the
<i>height of the tree</i>, which can well be logarithmic in the number of nodes
in the tree, and thus can be far more efficient than using a linked list. 
</p>

<h2>Binary Search Tree</h2>
<p>
Implement a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary
  search tree</a> with support for the following operations:
<ul>
    <li>Adding a integer to the tree.</li>
    <li>Removing a integer to the tree.</li>
    <li>Searching for a integer to the tree.</li>
    <li>Printing the values of the tree in sorted order.</li>
    <li>Printing the values of the tree in a breadth-first manner.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>The Token System</h2>
<p>
You will be given input as a stream of token numbers; the stream will be
terminated with an input of -1. For every token number, check if the token
already exists in the collection; if it does not, then add it, else remove it.
After each token number, print the whole entire collection in sorted order.
</p>

<p>
<b>Extra Credit:</b>Compare the performance of the token system implemented
using a linked list instead of the binary search tree.
